# Experimental
This folder contains the simulink models used to determine the transfer functions of robot systems.

## Motors
Motors contains step response data for each individual motor and MatLab code and models to determine the transfer function of each motor. 

## Velocity
Velocity contains MatLab code and models to determine the transfer function of the instataneuos velocity and rotational velocity transfer functions for the robot.
